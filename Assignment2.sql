-- SQL Queries for 9 Problems
-- Problem 1: Register a new ranger
INSERT INTO rangers (name, region)
VALUES ('Derek Fox', 'Coastal Plains');

-- Problem 2: Count unique species ever sighted
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT species_id) AS unique_species_count
FROM sightings;

-- Problem 3: Sightings where location includes "Pass"
SELECT * FROM sightings
WHERE location ILIKE '%Pass%';

-- Problem 4: Ranger name with total sightings
SELECT r.name, COUNT(s.sighting_id) AS total_sightings
FROM rangers r
LEFT JOIN sightings s ON r.ranger_id = s.ranger_id
GROUP BY r.name;

-- Problem 5: Species never sighted
SELECT common_name
FROM species
WHERE species_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT species_id FROM sightings);

-- Problem 6: Most recent 2 sightings
SELECT sp.common_name, s.sighting_time, r.name
FROM sightings s
JOIN species sp ON s.species_id = sp.species_id
JOIN rangers r ON s.ranger_id = r.ranger_id
ORDER BY s.sighting_time DESC
LIMIT 2;

-- Problem 7: Update species before 1800 to "Historic"
UPDATE species
SET conservation_status = 'Historic'
WHERE discovery_date < '1800-01-01';

-- Problem 8: Time of day label
SELECT sighting_id,
  CASE
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sighting_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sighting_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
    ELSE 'Evening'
  END AS time_of_day
FROM sightings;

-- Problem 9: Delete rangers with no sightings
DELETE FROM rangers
WHERE ranger_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT ranger_id FROM sightings
);
